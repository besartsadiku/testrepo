        <a href="/technical-cleared.html"><h4>Technical/Cleared Talent</h4>
        <p>We recognize that most of our customers should recruit 98% of their roles, but it is the 2% where PTS can be your go-to partner. We specialize in the "purple unicorns" technical roles such as IT, Shared Services, Medical, and Classified positions. From NATO Secret to TS/SCI Full Poly, we deeply understand the nuances of penetrating this niche talent base. We are very effective at bringing cleared talent to our customers. </p></a>

PTS bolts onto your Capture teams to find the most compliant and compelling talent for your bids. We lead an intense recruitment campaign, conduct compliance checks, obtain market intelligence, and manage the Letter of Commitment process, allowing Capture leaders to focus on the capture, not the recruitment.  </p></a>
